# Naming 

* Names should be meaningful. This is <b>not only</b> applicable for variables. i.e class names, packages or any programming construct that is allowed to be named depedning on the language, should be meaningful to the reader. 

* Follow the convention of the programming language. e.g using camel case for variable and method names in Java.

* Name booleans positively. 
```
        boolean isValid = true; // good
        boolean isNotValid = false;  // confusing
``` 

* Use singular names.
```
    itemList; // good
    items; // hard to differentiate with 'item'
```

* Be consistent. Not all programming languages might have conventions related to all of its constructs. If your team has already chosen a particular convention, stick to it.
