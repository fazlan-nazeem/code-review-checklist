# Commenting

* Comment only if necessary. e.g the following comment is abosluletely unncessary. 
```
  String name = "JohnDoe" // this variables stores the name
```
* When changing code that has comments associated with it, always check if the existing comment still holds after the change. A misleading comment is more dangerous than no comment at all.

* Do not commit commented code unless it has a potential to be uncommented in the near future. Do not use comments as a means for your fear of removing code.
