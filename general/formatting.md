# Formatting

* Each line of code should have a maximum length. A good measurement is that the line of code should fit into a 14-inch laptop screen. If the line becomes longer, break it to a newline. 

*  Use proper spacing.
```
    String name = "JohnDoe"; //yes
    String name= "JohnDoe"; //no
    
    for (String name: nameList) {  //yes
      ...
    }
    
    for(String name:nameList){ //no
      ...
    }

```

* Use proper alignment.
```
 while (isValid) { // yes
    ...   
 }
 
 while (isValid) { // no
    ...
      }
```

* Do not add *unnecessary* empty newlines at the end of each line of code. Find a perfect balance on when to use them.
